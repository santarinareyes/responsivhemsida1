    <p class="p-start">This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> - another important game guideline.</p>

        <h1 class="article1-h1">Youtubability</h1> 
        <p class="article1-p">A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity of your gameplay</strong> to a potential player.</p>
        
        <p class="article1-p">Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting the <strong>lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your games.</p>
                
        <p class="article1-p">Many elements can be used to make your game clearer:</p>

        <p class="article1-p">For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is <strong>evident</strong>, for example, can she tell which character she <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 seconds (too long!).</p>
        
        <p class="article1-p">Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.</p>

            <p class="article2-p">If you want to run user tests with f riends and family or even random people in the street, it is interesting to show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order to <strong>understand their</strong> expectations from the video vs. the actual game they try.</p>
            
            <p class="article2-p"><strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements that help <strong>understand the objective and controls</strong> of the game, like with the target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw Car with the space dedicated to drawing.</p>

                <p class="article3-p">People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their phone’s Facebook feed</strong>, everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. <strong>You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if someone watches it on a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is an <strong>accelerated elevator pitch!</strong></p>
